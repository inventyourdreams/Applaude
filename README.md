# Applaude
The purpose of this project is to be an application that would be able to provide an application visualization layer that would allow users to stream apps directly from developers, to each other or as a Pay to Run service that would allow free or paid trials for users to provide a more useful and economical solution to paid application purchasing or trying applications. The focus of the app is one of a interconnected web of Users, Large application design companies and Indie developers coming together to create a cross platform "Platform" that will hopefully change the way we develop, deploy and interract with mobile applications.
